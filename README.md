### [Demo](https://frosty-thompson-9a3093.netlify.app/)

This is my submission for Shopify's Developer challenge for Summer 2022.

## The Objective

The objective was to build a feed of the latest images from [NASA's API](https://api.nasa.gov/) and allow users to 'like' and 'unlike' them

### Features

- Search results should come from NASA's API ✓
- Display the title, date of capture, and button to like the image ✓
- Used a custom react theme ✓
- Animated the `like` action ✓
- Added a loading state while fetching data ✓
- Displays both videos and photos ✓
- Compatible for all devices ✓

### Improvements

There are several improvements that can be made to this app

- Create a back-end to hide API KEYs
- Save the likes if the user reloads the page
- Create shareable link for every image
- Add a date-picker to show photos from a specific date
